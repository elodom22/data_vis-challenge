# data_vis-challenge
This assignment challenges you to apply data visualization techniques using Matplotlib to analyze a real-world pharmaceutical study. As a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., your task is to process and visualize data from an animal study on squamous cell carcinoma, where 249 mice were treated with different drug regimens over 45 days. Your goal is to assess the effectiveness of Capomulin compared to other treatments by preparing the data, generating statistical summaries, and creating various visualizationsâ€”including bar charts, pie charts, box plots, line plots, and scatter plots. You'll also explore correlations and perform regression analysis to uncover meaningful insights for a clinical report. Ultimately, your findings will help the executive team evaluate the drug's performance.
